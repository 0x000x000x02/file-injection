# File injection example
## Introduction
 Example of injecting and deinjecting files into JPEG, ZIP, RAR and MPEG files.

 After the injection, the program prints the size of the camouflage file in bytes, which is later used for retrieving the hidden file.


## Usage
 **NOTE:** *Camouflage* is the file seen on the *outside* and *adrenalin* is the file hidden *inside*.
 
 `inject <camouflage> <adrenalin> <output>`

 `deinject <input> <deinject_point> <output_file>`

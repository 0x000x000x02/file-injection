# File injector
## Introduction
 Inject and deinject files into JPEG, ZIP, RAR AND MPEG FILES

 After the injection, the program prints something I call "deinject point" or the size of the camouflage file.
 It is used to retrieve the hidden file from the injected file.

## Usage
 **NOTE:** *Camouflage* is the file seen on the *outside* and *adrenalin* is the file hidden *inside*.
 `inject <camouflage> <adrenalin> <output>`

 `deinject <input> <deinject_point> <output_file>`
